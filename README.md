###Stat 240 Group Project 1


When working on code you're not yet ready to fully implement into a version of the project rmd file, make sure to commit it to a branch.

Merge the branch with main when you want everyone else to use your version so that it can be built off of.

Try to be careful with pulling and merging conflict resolution in your local repos so you don't accidently overwrite yours or someones work.
